# External Runtime Ownership and Lifecycle Boundaries

This document defines the architectural responsibilities, non-ownership invariants, and lifecycle boundaries when Rubix operates with an external host-managed Container Runtime Interface (CRI) runtime (containerd or CRI-O), as implemented in `rubix-cri` under Epic E10 ([#10](https://github.com/geoffsee/rubix-kube/issues/10)).

## 1. Architectural Overview

Rubix supports two operational runtime modes:
1. **Managed Mode (Bundled containerd)**: Rubix spawns, supervises, configures, and cleans up its own embedded containerd instance within its dedicated data directories.
2. **External Mode (Host containerd or CRI-O)**: Rubix connects strictly as a gRPC client over Unix domain sockets to an existing runtime managed by the host system (e.g., via `systemd`).

In External Mode, Rubix observes strict non-ownership boundaries across the entire process lifecycle (start, stop, restart, crash recovery, and uninstall).

## 2. Matrix of Host vs. Rubix Responsibilities

| Responsibility Area | Host System Responsibility | Rubix Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Runtime Daemon Installation** | Installs and upgrades containerd or CRI-O packages/binaries. | Out of scope. Never installs external runtimes. |
| **Daemon Execution & Lifecycle** | Spawns, monitors, and restarts the runtime process (e.g. systemd). | Never signals, kills, or supervises host runtime processes. |
| **Socket Management** | Creates, binds, and maintains the domain socket (`containerd.sock` / `crio.sock`). | Connects as a read/write client over Unix domain sockets. Never deletes, renames, or unlinks host sockets. |
| **Runtime Configuration** | Manages daemon configuration (`/etc/containerd/config.toml`, `/etc/crio/crio.conf`). | Out of scope. Never overwrites, edits, or alters host daemon configuration. |
| **Registry Configurations** | Configures mirror endpoints, TLS certificates (`certs.d`), and authentication. | Out of scope. External runtime pulls images using host-configured credentials/mirrors. |
| **Cgroups & System Settings** | Configures systemd/cgroupfs drivers, kernel sysctls, and storage drivers. | Queries `RuntimeConfig` to negotiate driver (`systemd` vs `cgroupfs`) and propagates setting to Kubelet. |
| **CNI Installation** | Installs host network plugins and system CNI if host-managed networking is chosen. | Out of scope. External mode manages only Rubix-owned CNI configuration (deferred to E15); never mutates `/etc/cni/net.d`. |
| **Workload Isolation** | Executes other system or third-party containers and sandboxes on the node. | Scopes container/sandbox management to Rubix-owned workloads. Never terminates or alters unrelated workloads. |
| **State Cleanup & Teardown** | Purges host state directories (`/var/lib/containerd`, `/var/lib/crio`) upon node decommissioning. | Never executes bundled-runtime cleanup (`clean_stale_runtime_state`) against host paths on restart or uninstall. |

## 3. Lifecycle Invariants

### 3.1 Start / Preflight
- Validates the provided Unix domain socket via `probe_cri_readiness`.
- Confirms runtime engine is supported (`containerd` or `cri-o`).
- Queries `RuntimeService::RuntimeConfig` to negotiate cgroup driver (`systemd` vs `cgroupfs`), falling back seamlessly to host cgroup detection if absent or unimplemented.
- **Never** executes bundled containerd cleanup routines or purges host `/var/lib/containerd` or `/var/lib/crio`.
- **Never** creates or mutates host registry host files.

### 3.2 Running
- Issues typed CRI v1 RPCs for pod sandbox and container lifecycle operations.
- Interacts only with workloads owned by Rubix (identified by namespace and management labels).
- Unrelated containers running under the same host runtime remain completely undisturbed.

### 3.3 Stop / Restart / Crash Recovery
- When Rubix shuts down or restarts, `ExternalRuntimeService` cooperatively releases gRPC connections and yields `Ok(())`.
- **No process termination**: Rubix does not send `SIGTERM`, `SIGKILL`, or any POSIX signals to the host runtime PID.
- **No socket unlinking**: Host sockets remain open and accessible for other consumers.
- **No state purge**: Ephemeral container state owned by host runtime is preserved across restarts.

### 3.4 Uninstall
- During `rubix uninstall` or reset, Rubix cleans only its own state directories (`/var/lib/rubix`).
- Host runtime sockets, binaries, data directories, registry certificates, and unrelated workloads are explicitly preserved.

## 4. Build Profiles vs. Runtime Modes

The distribution distinguishes build profiles from runtime modes:

| Build Profile | Description | Allowed Runtime Modes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `BuildProfile::Bundled` | Standard binary including embedded containerd and crun payloads. | `Managed` (standalone default), `External` (user-specified endpoint). |
| `BuildProfile::ExternalDeps` | Minimal binary built without embedded payloads (`--no-default-features` or external-deps mode). | `External` only. (Requesting `Managed` is rejected as an invalid combination). |

## 5. Verification & Testing

The ownership invariants are tested under `crates/rubix-cri/tests/runtime_ownership.rs`:
1. **Preservation of host process, sockets, and registry files** across start/stop/restart.
2. **Abortion of bundled cleanup** in external mode during uninstall.
3. **Preservation of unrelated workloads** running on the host runtime.
4. **Validation of the build profile and runtime mode matrix**.
5. **Enforcement of owned CNI path restrictions**.
