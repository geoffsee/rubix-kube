## Production dependency catalog

Catalog IDs below identify roles, not installed filenames or executable commands.
The code uses `containerd-shim-runc-v2` as the shim ID. The catalog has no production
blob records: source versions/references remain separate from caller-supplied
manifest metadata and encoded checks. Every runtime executable requires its own architecture/ABI-compatible
locked payload. Versions and source revisions alone do not satisfy that requirement.

There are 13 retained executable roles and six workload-image roles in the complete
accepted dependency catalog. Reusing identical payload bytes across libc variants
is allowed only after proving compatible ABI; this count is not a demand to duplicate
identical bytes. Host `fuse-overlayfs` is externally provided, not a fourteenth
bundled executable. SQLite is linked/dependency closure of Kine, not a separate
runtime command or newly selected Rust database. Neither the native metrics
endpoint nor native controllers imply a metrics-server/scheduler image. Do not add
unrequested components based on generic Kubernetes expectations.

Other explicitly modeled ownership records:

- `fuse-overlayfs` host helper: external capability/version observation; no bundled
  pin selected. Absence allows baseline native fallback. Presence must not be
  negated merely because the standalone plugin was forgotten in packaging (R1).
- External containerd/CRI-O: host-owned endpoint/capabilities/version, never a
  manifest instruction to install, stop or replace the daemon (G5,R1).
- apk/OpenRC/iptables/nft/mount/module helpers and container engine: E05/E15/E23/E24
  host prerequisite facts; do not copy arbitrary host binaries into E06 inventory.
- Rust node and four management release binaries: E27-produced distribution
  outputs. Their archive checksums/provenance can reuse schema primitives, but
  the node executable is not recursively a prerequisite asset for itself.
- crane/Go/protoc/build toolchains: preparation-only inputs, not shipped assets
  unless an explicit future distribution change adds them (G11,R1:70–74).

## Explicit16 target/variant expectation matrix

`E` = all13 executable roles above in an embedded-dependency release supporting
managed runtime, including the packaged optional fuse capability. Every selected
ELF must match the row's architecture and ABI. `C/P` = CoreDNS and pause.
`L/H` = local-path provisioner and its busybox helper. `A` = default agent.
`D` = D2K. Optional images in a generic offline archive are available payloads,
not permission to activate/import disabled components. Online omitted optional
images remain catalogued as registry acquisition obligations. All rows are
obligations, not assertions that the payloads currently exist or are qualified.

External-dependency build mode is an additional dimension, not a17th architecture.
The implemented `LegacyExternalDeps` scope only records the baseline empty
embedded-byte inventory; it does not assert supply of the newly supervised
executables. Future runtime requirements remain explicit integration work. The
crate compiles with no embedded payloads. E01 did not authorize
dropping any row because an official release lacks a prebuilt asset; a reproducible
source build may be required. OCI images have OS/architecture/variant, not the
host's libc classification; do not manufacture two separate image identities for
identical glibc/musl node rows.

## Existing pins, and exactly what they establish

The following values are copied from R3, not freshly resolved or invented:

| Raw artifact | Architecture | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
|kube-apiserver v1.35.7|arm64|`4e5fe160e7b90e84faab827e71a101f0472a920385abfb7f6bba36ee783529e1`|
|kube-apiserver v1.35.7|amd64|`0317e382c47b721af23dfcf853073fbe76ebe26a592dffc42359e20be21047a8`|
|Kine v0.16.3|arm64|`ced586344c072454336002cb07d1146400f70f989ecc1576fcf98fbf3e6e5cd8`|
|Kine v0.16.3|amd64|`1331b855502c9ba8f27d51531baa204e513b5d5056036d4ca453f06ef32ce976`|

The experiment exercised arm64 only. These are raw executable hashes, not compressed
blob hashes, ABI certifications, signatures, an offline release closure, or proof
of all four Kubernetes component behaviors. Sizes/ABI/build/license closure still
need explicit records. No production image digest is present in the reviewed
runtime catalog inputs.

Reusable source authority already recorded:

- Official Kubernetes revision `96cb9ab4201d88ce5e549fde047a686171838fdb` and
  archive SHA-256 `933b3b2dff0013ca42e33f984c026ce8a83ca8c2fd5f5c055177bcc0196a1592`
  (39,205,522bytes, R4).
- Official containerd server revision `e53c7c1516c3b2bff98eb76f1f4117477e6f4e66`
  in `docs/architecture/upstream-inputs.json`; API-module source is separately
  pinned and is not the containerd server executable.
- Kine v0.16.3 source revision `7414fca1dc92b44d7ec6de82383ba614a86d2994`
  is recorded in the accepted generation provenance; its source file hashes are
  evidence for that source, not substituted for the runtime executable.
- Fuse snapshotter v2.1.7 revision `da57796c7d0a2b608abf173651cf148706e33337` and
  entry-point source SHA-256
  `6dad105cf8b6972fac0fbf7b58343bad8db6c7917889248d5a542d0354a7060a`
  (2,695bytes, R1:53–59). That single source file is not a complete source archive
  or executable hash.

`tools/upstream/inputs.json`, defaults/API fixtures, VM input pins and Alpine APK
pins keep their existing purposes. Reuse matching authoritative source references;
do not merge those development/test payloads into the production asset inventory.

## Baseline deviations and gaps that must stay explicit

1. Supervised official binaries replace former in-process Go/K3s components (E01).
2. Standalone fuse plugin is separate from the official containerd bundle (E01).
3. Add the missing local-path helper to offline closure (E01/E06/E18).
4. Resolve mutable pause/agent/helper references to immutable content while keeping
   compatibility aliases. A tag spelling is never represented as a locked digest.
5. Verify existing binaries and new input bytes instead of baseline's any-existing-
   file shortcut and hash TODO. Bounded decompression replaces unbounded ReadAll.
   E06.02 owns actual atomic writes/permissions/cleanup, not this design slice.
6. Fail offline completeness before installation instead of silently accepting a
   missing archive and relying on baseline's later registry fallback.
7. Preserve custom-agent pull semantics as an explicit online exception. It cannot
   inherit the default-agent tarball's digest or an unconditional offline guarantee.
8. ARMv7/musl dependency closure needs a compatible recipe; compiling only the Rust
   node for musl does not repair a glibc-dependent embedded helper.


## Implemented boundary

`catalog()` exposes19 role/source/encoding records with no resolved production blob
pins. Supervised manifests must declare all19 roles and satisfy the exact matrix,
with registry-required or unavailable delivery where appropriate. Seven newly
supervised executables use identity encoding initially; the baseline six compressed
executables use zstd and image archives use gzip. `DeclaredInventory` validates
metadata only; `EncodedBlobMatch` adds only encoded length/SHA-256 verification.
Bounded ELF header/loader observations are described in ELF.md, with complete
compressed-executable decoding composition in DECODE.md. Full ELF/ABI qualification,
production decoded pins, general archive/OCI semantics, authenticated provenance,
immutable image resolution and install safety remain open. The narrow observations
and declared-manifest binding below do not close #48.

The narrow single-image Docker-save profile emitted by crane v0.21.5 now has
streaming outer archive/member/reference and config-platform observations; see
[ARCHIVE.md](ARCHIVE.md). Stored layer blob hashes are checked against archive
member names; this API alone leaves declared DiffIDs, nested layer integrity and
original registry manifest/index identity unverified. No production image pin is
introduced.

An optional stronger `verify_crane_image_layer_digests` call now verifies complete
bounded gzip/zstd layer-stream hashes against the declared DiffIDs; see
[LAYER-INTEGRITY.md](LAYER-INTEGRITY.md). It adds no production pins or authenticity
claim, and does not close unsupported-layer, inner-tar safety or install gates.

`LayerDigestArchiveObservation::bind_manifest` additionally binds the completed
observation to exact caller-declared archive and raw platform-manifest identities,
config and ordered stored-layer descriptors, and a declared Linux platform match;
see [MANIFEST-BINDING.md](MANIFEST-BINDING.md). Its OCI/Docker profiles are narrow.
The declaration remains unapproved policy input: index/tag resolution, publisher
authentication and production image pin approval are not established. Synthetic
contract tests do not substitute for independent real-manifest qualification or
the remaining inventory/ABI/materialization gates.
