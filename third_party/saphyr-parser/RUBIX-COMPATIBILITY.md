# Rubix YAML 1.1 scanner compatibility

This is the crates.io `saphyr-parser` 0.0.11 release, archive SHA-256
`ebfd783fcf1b3f6bafd557be0e1427ec54f826f513c3cdd749f9844484df2a13`.
`RUBIX-PROVENANCE.json` records every original packaged file hash. Original
licenses, notices, manifest and dependency requirements remain intact. The
separate `RUBIX-COMPATIBILITY.patch` contains the complete local source delta;
only `src/char_traits.rs` and `src/scanner.rs` differ from the published release.

Rubix selects `Parser::new_from_iter(input.chars())`, using `BufferedInput`.
The upstream `StrInput` fast path assumes ASCII line-break bytes and is not the
qualified entry point for this compatibility patch. Rubix does not expose a parser
constructor to callers and must retain the iterator constructor when upgrading.
No runtime dependencies were added. The root lock retains thiserror 2.0.18 to
avoid duplicate syn major versions alongside the Kubernetes generators.

The patch restores source-character semantics required by the pinned Go baseline:
NEL is a normalized LF; LS/PS remain distinct line breaks; CRLF remains one break,
while CR followed by another Unicode separator remains two. Plain/quoted/block
folding and chomping distinguish LF from LS/PS. A closing quote may terminate a
scalar below its parent indentation, matching baseline-emitted YAML; nonclosing
text still follows the upstream indentation checks. Quoted escapes remain data
and backslash line continuations use the scanner's existing state machine.

The rejected preprocessing prototype is not present. Original input-size,
expanded-node/string-byte and depth budgets remain in `rubix-config`; aliases are
charged before copying. There is no sentinel namespace or normalization-expansion
allocation. Upstream library unit tests pass (5); 57 direct pinned Go `config.Read`
observations and the preexisting 17 Rubix compatibility tests pass. The Go capture
includes raw typed JSON before YAML printing, because its emitter loses escaped
NEL. That printer difference is separately owned by E03.02.

The upstream YAML 1.2 conformance suite is not claimed as a qualification gate for
these deliberately selected YAML 1.1 semantics. An upgrade must replay the direct
Go oracle, resource-limit tests and upstream tests, review the source patch and
qualify the selected input implementation. Replacing this fork with an upstream
YAML 1.1 mode is preferred if equivalent behavior becomes available.
